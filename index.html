          <p>
            I've done quite a bit! Tennis instructor, music studio owner, public employee, stock market analyst, finacial advisor. And after 12 years in financial markets, I wanted to seek another challenge and joined Le Wagon's Batch 138 in São Paulo to become a professional software developer.

          <h3> Brief story! </h3>
          <hr>
          <p> I have a degree in Economics and MBA in Capital Markets. But before i entered this field i was an amateaur musician who had a music studio at home. Altough it was a lot of fun and a great experience working with some talented musicians, it barely paid the bills. So i decided to go for the field i was studying in college. I passed a test and joined Banrisul as a public employee. After 5 years, seeing that at a public bank i wouldn't have chances to grow, i decided to apply for a job at a major private bank, where i could have more oportunities. That's when i was called by Bradesco to join their Stock Brokers team in Porto Alegre. After 7 very good years i decided to make another carreer change. Seeing that the future is heading towards technology, and since i've been a fan of this field for so long, i felt i had to switch to it. I then atended a Bootcamp on Full Stack Web Development and i'm currently atending college again to obtain masters in Information Systems.  </p>

                    <p> The idea here is to build a large database of high-schools in Brazil and let their users (students, parents, teachers) rate and leave comments about them. This way we could compare schools not only by their students grades on common tests, but by the opinion of all involved in the process. </p>
